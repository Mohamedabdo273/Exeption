Exception Handling..

A try block is used by C# programmers to partition code that might be affected by an exception.
Associated catch blocks are used to handle any resulting exceptions. 
A finally block contains code that is run whether or not an exception is thrown in the try block,
such as releasing resources that are allocated in the try block.

A try block requires one or more associated catch blocks, or a finally block, or both.
